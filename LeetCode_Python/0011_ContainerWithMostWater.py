11. Container With Most Water

Description:
    You are given an integer array height of length n. 
    There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

    Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, 
    such that the container contains the most water.

    Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

    Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
    Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49
    Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, 
    the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
    Input: height = [1,1]
    Output: 1

Constraints:
    n == height.length
    2 <= n <= 10⁵
    0 <= height[i] <= 10⁴
