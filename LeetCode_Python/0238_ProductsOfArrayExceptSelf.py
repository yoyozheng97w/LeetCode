238. Products of Array Except Self

Description:
    Given an integer array nums, 
    return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
    The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
    Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
    Output: [0,0,9,0,0]


Constraints:
    2 <= nums.length <= 105
    -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
    The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
