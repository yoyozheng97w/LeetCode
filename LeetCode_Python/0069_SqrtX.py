69. Sqrt(x)

Description:
    Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

    You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

    For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

Example 1:
    Input: x = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

Example 2:
    Input: x = 8
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., 
    and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

Constraints:
    0 <= x <= 231 - 1
